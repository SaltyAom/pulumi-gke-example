## Note: Archive
I have just getting started with Kubernetes and have no real-experience using Kubernetes on production.
This is like a script I wrote to experiment with [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com). Proceed with caution.

# Pulumi GKE Example
This script automate deployment of Kubernete to Google Kubernetes Engine.
